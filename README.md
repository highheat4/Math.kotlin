# Math.kotlin


I designed this program for a much younger cousin that I would like to tutor. Since said cousin is only a couple years old, I created an app that would test addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with problem sets of seven. The student is able to choose a problem type. There is also a mixed problem set that would randomize the type of problem given. Each problem is generated using random integer selection from 1-100, 1-20, 1-400, or 1-30 depending on the type selection.

Currently, this app is horribly mean since the app will not let a student go to the main activity page until all 
7 questions are correct, and only the first incorrect answer will show at a time.


Using Kotlin:
At first, using Kotlin seemed to be holding me back from coding much of the back end efficiently. When I started coding the portion of code that would generate the problem text and solutions list, I saw how efficient Kotlin could be once used properly. Essentially, what would have been one long if statement that called 5 methods outside of the original, I could just use a couple nested for loops. When the "Mixed" bit of code seemed daunting, the solution was as easy as adding another if statement within its for loop. Although I might have abused Kotlin a bit here, using it in my programming reminded me of the times Java could (and should) have been much quicker to write in cs125, and how much easier it would have been with Kotlin.

Troubles with Programming:
The hardest part of programming the app would have to be using the User Interface. I feel as if I had a clear idea of what I wanted and how I would write the back-end, but the front end forced me to grind multiple hours online searching for ways to do otherwise simple tasks.

For the Future:
For its current purposes, I feel that the app works pretty well and in a way that it is meant to. I know that my cousin would be able to do the problems properly and without too much of a hassle - currently the keyboard sometimes gets in the way of the problems so it has to be minimized and reopened - but otherwise everything works fine. In the future I would update the UI to be a lot more attention grabbing for children, and perhaps add more futures that test more than basic computation for older students.

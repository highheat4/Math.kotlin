# Math.kotlin


I designed this program for a much younger cousin that I would like to tutor. Since said cousin is only a couple years old, 
I created an app that would test addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with problem sets of seven. There
is also a mixed problem set that would randomize the type of problem given.

Currently, this app is horribly mean since the app will not let a student go to the main activity page until all 
7 questions are correct, but I haven't yet implemented a system to indicate which question the student got wrong.
This is for future development.
